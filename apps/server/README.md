Wealthfolio Server

Overview
- This crate runs the HTTP API (Axum) and serves static files for the web build.
- It uses the shared Rust crates for business logic, repositories, and migrations.

Run locally (Rust only)
- From the repo root:
  - `cargo run --manifest-path apps/server/Cargo.toml`

Docker image
- Pull the latest published server image with `docker pull wealthfolio/wealthfolio:latest`.
- Use that tag (or your locally built image) in the Docker run examples inside the root `README.md`.

Key environment variables
- `WF_LISTEN_ADDR`: Bind address, default `0.0.0.0:8088`.
- `WF_DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (or a directory; if a directory is provided, `app.db` is used inside it). Example: `./db/app.db`.
- `WF_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS. Example: `http://localhost:1420`.
- `WF_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`: Request timeout in milliseconds. Default `300000`.
- `WF_STATIC_DIR`: Directory to serve static assets from (the web build output). Default `dist`.
- `WF_SECRET_KEY`: 32-byte key (required unless `WF_SECRET_KEY_FILE` is set) used to encrypt secrets at rest and sign JWTs. Must decode to exactly 32 bytes.
  Can be provided as:
  - Base64-encoded string (recommended): Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` or `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`
  - 32-byte ASCII string: Must be exactly 32 characters (less secure if contains only printable characters)
  Example: `WF_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)`.

- `WF_SECRET_KEY_FILE`: Optional path to a UTF-8 file containing the same master key.
  Read once at startup; LF/CRLF endings are accepted. Leave `WF_SECRET_KEY` unset or
  empty when using this. Conflicting inputs or unreadable/invalid files fail startup.
  Reuse the existing key when switching inputs. In Docker, mount it read-only and
  use its container path. Keep the key separate from encrypted vault backups.
- `WF_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`: Enables password-only authentication for web mode when set to an Argon2id PHC string.
  Generate via online tools like [argon2.online](https://argon2.online/) or the CLI (`argon2-utils` package):
  ```bash
  printf 'your-password' | argon2 yoursalt16chars! -id -e
  ```
  The first argument is the **salt** (use 16+ characters); the password is read from stdin.
  Use `printf` instead of `echo -n` to avoid hidden newline issues.
  For Docker Compose `.env`/`--env-file`, single-quote the value or double every `$`;
  for YAML inline values, double every `$` in the hash (`$$argon2id$$...`).
  When unset, authentication is not configured. The server refuses to start on non-loopback
  addresses without authentication unless `WF_AUTH_REQUIRED=false` is set; for local no-auth use
  `WF_LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8088`.
- `WF_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES`: Optional JWT access token lifetime (minutes). Defaults to `60`.
- OIDC / SSO (optional): authenticate via any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, PocketID, Authelia, Keycloak, …). OIDC is an alternative to `WF_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`; either or both can be enabled, and a successful SSO login mints the same session cookie. OIDC is enabled when **both** of the first two are set:
  - `WF_OIDC_ISSUER_URL`: Provider base URL. Discovery hits `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` at startup.
  - `WF_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`: Client id registered with the IdP.
  - `WF_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`: Optional client secret (PKCE is always used; set this for confidential clients).
  - `WF_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`: Required when OIDC is enabled. Must be registered in the IdP, e.g. `https://your.host/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback`.
  - `WF_OIDC_SCOPES`: Optional space-separated scopes. Default `openid email profile`.
  - `WF_OIDC_ALLOWED_EMAILS` / `WF_OIDC_ALLOWED_SUBS`: Comma-separated allowlists matched against the ID token's `email` / `sub` claims. With neither set, the server **refuses to start** unless `WF_OIDC_ALLOW_ANY=true` is also set — a missing allowlist must never silently grant every IdP user access. An `email` is only honored when the IdP asserts `email_verified=true`; `WF_OIDC_ALLOWED_SUBS` is the stronger control (the `sub` is stable and issuer-scoped) and is recommended on shared/multi-tenant IdPs.
  - `WF_OIDC_ALLOW_ANY`: **Optional**, default `false`. Set to `true` to allow **any** user the IdP authenticates when no allowlist is configured. Only safe on a dedicated single-user IdP; on a shared/multi-tenant IdP this grants everyone access. A warning is logged at startup when enabled.
  - `WF_OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`: **Optional**. When the IdP advertises an `end_session_endpoint`, sign-out performs RP-Initiated Logout (ends the IdP session too); otherwise logout is local-only. Set this to return to the app after IdP logout — it must be **registered** with the IdP (e.g. Keycloak's "Valid post logout redirect URIs"). If unset, the IdP shows its own logged-out page.
  - `WF_OIDC_RP_LOGOUT`: **Optional**, default `true`. Set to `false` to force local-only logout even when the IdP supports RP-Initiated Logout.
- `WF_SECRET_FILE`: Optional override for where encrypted secrets are stored. Defaults to `<data-root>/secrets.json`.
- `WF_DB_REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION`: Optional, default `0`. Requires the live database to
  match the configured encryption policy. `1` creates a new encrypted database,
  but does not convert an existing plaintext file. Stop the server and use
  `wealthfolio-server db encrypt` or `db decrypt` for conversion, preserving the
  same master key and setting the startup flag to match afterward.

Notes
- The server also honors `DATABASE_URL`; when running in this workspace, `WF_DB_PATH` is preferred and propagated to `DATABASE_URL` internally so the core layer uses the expected path.
- Database migrations are embedded and applied automatically on startup.
- Secrets in web/server mode are stored in an encrypted JSON file derived from the database directory using `WF_SECRET_KEY`.

Existing vault files keep their ownership, permissions, ACLs and link targets.
Individual file mounts and writable vaults in non-writable directories remain
supported. Existing-file updates happen in place, as before; they are not
crash-atomic. File creation retains the existing platform permission behavior.
Unreadable or corrupt vaults report errors on secret operations without preventing unrelated server
features from starting. Run one server process per vault, including upgrades.

## File-based master key

Use `WF_SECRET_KEY_FILE` instead of `WF_SECRET_KEY` to read the existing master
key from a UTF-8 file at startup. Use the same key value when switching inputs.
Protect the file and grant the server account read access.

macOS/Linux:

```bash
unset WF_SECRET_KEY
export WF_SECRET_KEY_FILE=/protected/wealthfolio-key
cargo run --manifest-path apps/server/Cargo.toml
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:WF_SECRET_KEY -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$env:WF_SECRET_KEY_FILE = 'C:\protected\wealthfolio-key.txt'
cargo run --manifest-path apps/server/Cargo.toml
```

Also remove or leave empty `WF_SECRET_KEY` in any `.env` file loaded by the
server. Both nonempty inputs are rejected. The file contents use the same key
format as the environment input; LF/CRLF endings are accepted. Restart after
changing the input file: it is not watched or reloaded.

For container mounts and deployment examples, see
[self-hosting configuration](../../docs/self-host/README.md#master-key-configuration).
The [credential storage architecture](../../docs/architecture/credential-storage.md)
explains the native backends and server vault.

## Backups and portable recovery

The Backups screen creates managed snapshots and exports password-protected
portable files. Server restore is offline: stop the service, then run
`wealthfolio-server db restore <file> [--password-stdin] [--yes]` with the same
key, database path, user and encryption policy. Without `--yes`, validation shows
a summary without replacing the database. Passwords are accepted only through
non-terminal standard input, never command arguments.

The command requires an existing readable destination, validates the backup and
saves a pre-restore snapshot. A portable backup password is independent of the
server master key. There are no web restore/upload or maintenance/retry endpoints.
See [the operator backup guide](../../docs/self-host/backups.md) for safe password
input, container commands, cross-platform transfers and failed-startup recovery.
