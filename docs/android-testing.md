# Android testing

Run commands from the repository root. The generated Android project is already
tracked; there is no need to run `tauri android init` for an existing checkout.

## macOS setup

Install Android Studio with SDK platform 36, platform tools, an emulator system
image, and NDK `28.2.13676358` (the version pinned by the Android project).

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/28.2.13676358"
# Vendored OpenSSL needs the NDK LLVM indexer; GNU-prefixed ranlib is absent.
export RANLIB_aarch64_linux_android="$NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/llvm-ranlib"
export RANLIB_armv7_linux_androideabi="$RANLIB_aarch64_linux_android"
export RANLIB_i686_linux_android="$RANLIB_aarch64_linux_android"
export RANLIB_x86_64_linux_android="$RANLIB_aarch64_linux_android"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$PATH"
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

SQLCipher builds vendored OpenSSL, which requires Perl and the NDK toolchain.
The target-specific `RANLIB_*` variables above are required for CLI builds with
this NDK; its old GNU-prefixed `ranlib` binaries are absent. On Linux, use the
`linux-x86_64` prebuilt directory; on Windows, use
`windows-x86_64/bin/llvm-ranlib.exe`. The tracked Gradle build task configures
LLVM ranlib automatically for Android Studio builds.

## Run with live reload

Start an emulator from Android Studio's Device Manager, or connect a device with
USB debugging enabled and accept its debugging prompt.

```sh
adb devices -l
pnpm tauri android dev
```

To start an emulator from the terminal, list your configured virtual devices and
use one of the returned names:

```sh
emulator -list-avds
emulator -avd "YOUR_AVD_NAME"
```

Prefer a 16 KB system image to exercise native-library alignment;
`adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE` should print `16384` on that image.

## Build an installable test APK

```sh
pnpm tauri android build --debug --apk --target aarch64
adb install -r apps/tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/debug/app-universal-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.teymz.wealthfolio/.MainActivity
```

This APK bundles the frontend and does not need a running Vite server. It uses
the checkout's configured service endpoints. Use test accounts and sample data.
The ARM64 target works with Apple Silicon ARM64 emulators and ARM64 devices; use
`x86_64` and its corresponding Rust target for an x86_64 emulator.

## Smoke tests

- Cold launch: no native crash or 16 KB compatibility warning; onboarding
  renders.
- Onboarding: create a test portfolio, select a currency, and reach the
  dashboard.
- Navigation: open accounts, holdings, activities, and settings; check Android
  Back, keyboard dismissal, and content around system bars.
- Persistence: restart the app and confirm test data and settings remain.
- Database encryption: enable it in General Settings, force-stop and reopen the
  app, and verify the same test data is readable. Export a portable backup,
  disable encryption, restart, and restore the export. Re-enable encryption to
  verify the retained key still works.
- Recovery: use an explicit portable export when moving to another device.
  Android automatic backup excludes the database and internal backups because
  their Keystore-protected key cannot accompany them. This also applies while
  database encryption is disabled.
- Files: import a sample CSV through the Android picker; export CSV and a
  database backup to Downloads. Restore that test backup and verify the data
  after restart. Also cancel each picker and check that the app remains usable.
- Connect: complete native browser sign-in and return to the app; repeat with
  cancellation. Verify session restoration after restarting the app.
- Device sync: pair with a test desktop instance, including the QR scanner's
  camera permission flow, then verify a sample update in both directions.

## Checks

```sh
pnpm test --run
pnpm type-check
cargo check -p wealthfolio-app -p wealthfolio-server
git diff --check
```

Inspect native crash reports with `adb logcat -b crash -d`. Avoid sharing raw
app logs or database files that contain account details or financial data.
